Currently ride is only viable for rails or NewGem ruby projects, though
support for more generic projects is on the way.  

USAGE:
from the root of a rails or newgem project -
  $ ride .
  $ ./script/ride --help
  $ ./script/ride <options>

With no options you get an IDE with 9 windows open, irb on window 1 and
a root file browser on 2.  The other windows suppose you're in a rails tree,
but can be changed with command line options or changes to the template
in config/.screenrc.code.erb, which you can replace or copy to make
a new screen template.  The home directory in the IDE is changed to
the projects' root so cd ~ takes you to the project root on a console window.
Your actual home is available via the $REAL_HOME environment variable.  

Tip: Hit F12 while editing any ruby file and the current state of the buffer
     will be loaded in irb, and you'll be switched to that window
