RailsEditor
===========

This is an ide primarily for console junkies, but GUIusers who deploy to servers
may find some use in it as a debugging system for apps which are deployed to *nix
servers which have screen and vim (or emacs, this does support screen + emacs, as well).

In a pinch it's a bit more handy than vim by itself.

TODO: Add rails.vim on window 2 (and maybe all the editing/vim windows)
      Add auto-testing script to window 9
      Make some tests for this thing, just ported the old RailsEditor code

Example
=======

./script/editor -M -U deathsyn,trey

would start a multi-user screen which allowed users deathsyn and trey to also connect to it
